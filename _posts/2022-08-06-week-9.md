## Introduction
This post is meant to be a reference for the work I've done during the ninth week. 

## Week 9
This week has been fairly intense; I had a lot of work to do and was able to do what I had planned.

The following are the new RcppDeepState-action features:
* Added support for the `verbose` option to control RcppDeepState's output verbosity. This parameter was added to RcppDeepState in the previous weeks, and I finally included it to the action; 
* linked the current GitHub Action with Docker Hub. As a result of this update, the overall time required to run the action has been decreased from an average of 20-30 minutes to less than 10 minutes;
* made better use of the `find` command. It found that using the `find` command within the action without providing the maximum search depth resulted in a slight latency overhead. I fixed this by specifying the depth and making some changes to this command usage. 


In terms of RcppDeepState:
* resolved the issue where wrong inputs were included in the result table. I solved this by moving the "Inputs Dump" code to the runner test; 
* implemented `ci_setup function`. Developers can use this function to automatically initialize a workflow file within their repositories for the RcppDeepState analysis;
* improved and revised the harness creation process, making some additional changes in response to the usability test performed by my mentors; 
* added the functionality that allows developers to provide a custom test harness if RcppDeepState cannot generate it automatically for a function (function's parameters are not within the permitted ones); 
* resolved the dwarf support issue that occurs when Valgrind is used with Clang version 14.
