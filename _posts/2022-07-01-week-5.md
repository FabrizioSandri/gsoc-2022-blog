title: â–¸ Week 5 Summary - GitHub Action prototype
---

## Introduction
This post is meant to be a reference for the work I've done during the fifth week. 


## Week 5
The primary goal of this week was to finish the first working prototype of the RcppDeepState's GitHub Action.
The requirements analysis was the first step, therefore I produced a blog article to serve as a reminder of key things to think about before moving on to the effective development phase. I then started working on the Action's actual implementation, writing a basic structure based on a Docker Action. Then I made some improvements, by adding a `location` argument that allows to run RcppDeepState in repositories where the package that needs to be analyzed isn't in the root folder. Finally I created a workflow to test the Action and see the output results. 
In the meanwhile I continued working on the RcppDeepState library.
