## Introduction
This post is meant to be a reference for the work I've done during the seventh week. 


## Week 7
I have spent most of this week's time working on the RcppDeepState GitHub Action. As discussed in my previous blog post[^1] I decided to integrate the actual docker based action with a composite one. Thanks to the precious advices of my mentors, I have performed this update, moving the actual docker architecture to the `docker` folder of the repository and creating a new `action.yml` file for the composite architecture. In this way the final result is a more flexible action that can be easily integrated with other actions available on the marketplace. In particular I have done the following improvements:
* artifact upload: the results of RcppDeepState analysis are compressed in a zip file and uploaded as an artifact file to GitHub. By doing this, the user can easily download the analysis results and check the logs, inputs and outputs; 
* comment on pull request: the table that is returned by the analysis step can be printed in the pull requests if the `comment` parameter of the action is set to `true`. 
Here is a example of a comment message

* new `fail_ci_if_error` parameter: allows developers to define whether the workflow should fail if at least one error is found by RcppDeepState; 


In terms of RcppDeepState, I improved the harness creation procedure by deleting some superfluous if/else lines and reorganizing all the information for each supported datatype into a data.table structure.
