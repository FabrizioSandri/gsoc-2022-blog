## Introduction
This post is meant to be a reference for the work I've done during the twelfth
week. 

## Week 12
My mentor has assigned me an interesting task to begin working on this week: 
test the current RcppDeepState GitHub Action on GitHub-hosted Rcpp-based 
packages. This was the main task of this week. With the help of a blog post, I
carefully described all of the processes required to beta test the 
RcppDeepState-action. 

Regarding RcppDeepState the changes of this week amount to:
* solved the issue that happens when a function takes a `std::string` as 
input. This issue was caused by the conversion to string using
`Rcpp::as<std::string>`;
* solved the issue caused by RcppDeepState that overwrites the default 
`Makevars` file with a flag to include debug symbols in the compiled shared 
object file `(PKG_CXXFLAGS += -g)`;
* written a wiki page to serve as a reference for users who want to extend 
RcppDeepState's support for additional datatypes.

Talking about RcppDeepState-action:
* solved the issue with the `getErrorsCount` function's unusual error message, 
`'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'`. This resulted from the 
incorrect use of the list's `sum` function and the `lapply` function. The 
solution was to use `sapply` instead of `lapply` to create a vector; 
* changed the name of the `time_limit` parameter to `max_seconds_per_function`. 
This clarifies the time limit parameter's measurement unit;
* checked whether single quotes are required for parameters like booleans and 
integers inside workflow files;
