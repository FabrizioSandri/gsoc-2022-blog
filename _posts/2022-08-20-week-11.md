title: â–¸ Week 11 Summary
---

## Introduction
This post is meant to be a reference for the work I've done during the eleventh
week. 

## Week 11
This week I have been working ob both RcppDeepState and it's GitHub Action. 


Starting with RcppDeepState:
* implemented new checks for non-zero test harness exit status codes. If an 
error occurs before deepstate can execute, it will be reported in this way.
* fixed the problem that occurs when the folder containing the package being 
analyzed is not called the same as the package's name; in this case, the harness
will not be evaluated. This is due to the fact that RcppDeepState utilizes the
package name as the unit test name, and if a different name is given, Deepstate
is unable to identify the test to execute. 


Regarding RcppDeepState-action:
* inserted a link referencing the commit SHA that generated the report;
* updated the hyperlinks in the `file line` and `address trace` columns to the 
commit SHA rather than the pull request: the pull request code can change over 
time, so it is preferable to refer to the commit SHA rather than the pull 
request inside hyperlinks; 
* added the inputs generator seed in the `Report details` paragraph of the 
comment.

* added a third column to the summary table that indicates the number of inputs
which caused at least one valgrind message/issue for each function; 
* changed all of the column names to eliminate the underscore character between
words;
* I solved the problem with the report that exceeded the maximum allowable 
comment size that I started last week. This week, I added a step to the Action
that uploads an artifact file that contains the whole report file if it has been
truncated.


### New look of the Action's comment
This is the new look of the GitHub comment after the updates of this week.
