## Introduction
This post is meant to be a reference for the work I've done during the 
thirteenth week. 

## Week 13
This week's major emphasis was on beta testing and resolving bugs uncovered 
during beta testing. I was able to automatically beta test certain packages and
analyze the results using the scripts that I wrote in two of my earlier blog 
posts. You can find more details on the results that I obtained in the 
[dedicated blog post](https://fabriziosandri.github.io/gsoc-2022-blog/github%20action/2022/09/02/beta-test-summary.html).

Starting with RcppDeepState:
* RcppDeepState failed with an error saying that the package has missing 
dependencies when run on packages having certain dependencies under the 
`linkingTo` field. As a consequence of a conversation with my mentor, I found a
solution for this problem: substitute the `R CMD INSTALL` system command with 
the `install.packages` function used to construct the library's shared object. 
This manner, we avoid using system commands, which is usually a bad idea if the 
goal is to make RcppDeepState multiplatform. In addition, I reviewed the 
prerequisites for running RcppDeepState: in order to run RcppDeepState, the user
must install all missing dependencies pf the tested package, using for example 
`devtools::install()`;
* As a consequence of beta testing, Dr.Martin R. Smith, creator of multiple R 
packages available on CRAN, needed support for the `IntegerMatrix` datatype in 
one of his packages. After following the [wiki page description](https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState/wiki/Add-a-new-datatype-to-RcppDeepState), 
he sent a pull request to the RcppDeepState repository, requesting me to add 
this new datatype. This was a successful outcome that allowed me to confirm that
the process for adding a new datatype is well documented. 

Regarding RcppDeepState-action the changes apported this week amount to:
* changed the name of the `time_limit` parameter to `max_seconds_per_function`;
* checked whether single quotes are required for parameters like booleans and 
integers inside workflow files;
* solved the problem that caused the action's log to include a warning message: 
`rm: missing operand`;
* solved the issue that caused a duplicate concatenation of the `src` path in
the hyperlinks of the comment;
* strengthened the tests on NA values to avoid unexpected errors;
* moved the package installation procedure to the action code. This manner, it 
will only be run once, rather to each time a RcppDeepState makefile is created. 
`devtools::install` is used to install the package with its dependencies.
