## Introduction
This post is meant to be a reference for the work I've done during the eighth week. 


## Week 8
I had planned to begin improving the GitHub action's execution time this week, however after meeting with my mentor I opted to postpone this task so that I could focus on other high priority tasks.


I have spent most of this week's time improving the Action's commenting system. In detail I have:
* added a new column `R_code` containing the executable code that can be directly copied and pasted by the user that wants to test a particular function given the inputs;
* added a summary table when RcppDeepState doesn't find any error;
* added a thard option for the action's `comment` parameter, the `failure` value. This parameters is used to specify to the action that a comment should be added to the pull request only when RcppDeepState finds at least one error;
* changed the action such that it adds the comment once in a pull request and updates it in subsequent runs;
* minor changes: removed the `inputs` column since the inputs are under the `R_code` column; fixed the broken hyperlinks; modified the conditions that are applied when the step that adds a comment runs, solving the problem caused by the parameter `fail ci if error` that prevented the execution of the subsequent steps.
