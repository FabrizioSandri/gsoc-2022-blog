This blog is meant to contain all the post regarding my progress throughout the Google Summer of Code 2022.

In this GSOC edition I will contribute to the RcppDeepState project for the R project for statistical computing organization.


## Project description
Fuzzing is a useful technique for finding and avoiding programming problems by sending programs invalid sets of non-deterministic inputs. 
The RcppDeepState package allows developers to perform fuzz testing on libraries that use Rcpp for some specific functionalities. 
The main purpose of this project is to provide a custom GitHub Action that makes it simple for developers to use RcppDeepState's fuzzing 
techniques on any R package on GitHub. In addition, improvements to the existing RcppDeepState library will also be implemented in order 
to proceed with the publication of the package on CRAN.
