<h1 style="text-align: center;">Google Summer of Code 2022 Blog</h1>

This blog is intended to include all of my progress throughout the [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
In this  Google Summer of Code edition I will contribute to the RcppDeepState project for [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) organization.


### Project description
Fuzzing is a useful technique for finding and avoiding programming problems by sending programs invalid sets of non-deterministic inputs. 
The RcppDeepState package allows developers to perform fuzz testing on libraries that use Rcpp for some specific functionalities. 
The main purpose of this project is to provide a custom GitHub Action that makes it simple for developers to use RcppDeepState's fuzzing 
techniques on any R package on GitHub. In addition, improvements to the existing RcppDeepState library will also be implemented in order 
to proceed with the publication of the package on CRAN.
